# Team Dashboard

Built a dynamic web application to provide team managers easy access to business analytics, transactions, and various integrated project management features such as a Kanban board.

## Tech Stack

**Client:** React, TailwindCSS, and Syncfusion

## Features

- Light/dark mode toggle
- Team Calendar
- Employees and Customer pages for team management.
- Kanban Board for Project Management
- E-Commerce Order History

An additional feature that I will be implementing is live team chats for communication between members of the organization.
